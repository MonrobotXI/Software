## Programs from Jeff Reid's archives.

A listing for a quadratic equation I wrote back in 1967 on the Monrobot XI,
one of my earliest programs. Attached are 3 images of it, plus an image of laced punched cards used
to identify card drawers when we got the 1130.

I transcribed the program.
Changed the comments to use current terminology.
