# John Mann's Monrobot XI recollections

My old [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20120405020342/http://users.monash.edu.au/~johnm/weblog/2007/03/15/#monrobot-xi).

Scans of Monrobot XI prohrams and output. I hope to turn these back into text, then paper tpae images to load into an emulator.

Various programs to help create these paper tape images.
